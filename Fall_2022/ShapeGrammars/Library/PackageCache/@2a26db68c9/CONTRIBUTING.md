# How to contribute
Any help given on this project is massively appreciated! ‚ù§

Contributing can be done by writing docs and code, or simply by asking a
question! If you find something questionable, then so will probably many others
as well. If you find something not working as expected, telling us or publish a
pull request that fixes it is the best way around this.

Before starting, please read the guidelines on the subject on which you wish to
dig into before contributing to Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity.

  Android, WebGL, even the Editor?)

- If possible, please include code that reproduces the issue. [Dropbox][dropbox]
  or GitHub's [Gist][gist] can be used to share large code samples, or you could
  [submit a pull request](#submitting-a-pull-request) with the issue reproduced
  in a new test.
